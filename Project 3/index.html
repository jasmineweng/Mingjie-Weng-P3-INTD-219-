      <h3>Discovering the present moment.</h3>
      <h5>
        Meditation isn’t about becoming a different person, a new person, or even a better person. It’s about training in awareness and getting a healthy sense of perspective. You’re not trying to turn off your thoughts or feelings. You’re learning to observe them without judgment. And eventually, you may start to better understand them as well.
        </h5>
        <h5>  Meditation is a skill. Learning to meditate is like learning any other skill. Think of it like exercising a muscle that you’ve never really worked out before. It takes consistent practice to get comfortable. And it’s usually easier if you have a teacher. We’ve got you covered there.</h5>

            <h2 id="part-2">How to start meditating
            </h2>
            <h3>A few tips to get started.</h3>
            <h5>
              Learning how to meditate is a fairly straightforward process, especially if you’re able to follow these simple steps:
              </h5>
            <h5>Step 1: Decide on a time and place that works for you. Research shows that it’s easiest to create a new habit when we do it at the “same time, same place” every day. Just don’t overthink it: The best time to meditate is really whenever you can best prioritize it. And the best place to meditate? Wherever you can be comfortable and minimally distracted.</h5>
          <h5>Step 2: Decide on an amount of time to meditate. Particularly for beginners, starting with small, manageable chunks of time — for example, 3-, 5-, or 10-minute sessions — is key, so you can build up your practice and find your sweet spot. The most important thing is to decide on an amount of time that is effective, but also feels achievable so you continue to show up day after day.</h5>
          <h5>Step 3: Make sure you’re sitting comfortably. Sit with your legs and arms uncrossed, feet flat on the floor, and hands resting on your lap or by your side. Keep your back straight, but not too tense. If you need it, a small cushion or rolled up towel can help keep your back straight.</h5> 
          <h5>Step 4: Decide whether you want the meditation to be guided or unguided. A guided meditation is led by an experienced teacher — either in person at a meditation group or class, or via audio or video as in the Headspace app. Guided meditation is recommended for people who are learning how to meditate. Most guided meditations follow a similar format: the teacher explains how the mind behaves during meditation, leads you through a particular meditation technique, and finishes by suggesting how to integrate this technique into your everyday life.</h5>

      <h2 id="part-3">Common Hurdles
      </h2>
      <h3>Meditation only looks simple. It can be surprisingly difficult — and that doesn’t mean you’re failing.</h3>
      <h5>
        Self-Criticism: When we begin meditating, it’s all too common to beat up on ourselves. I’m doing it wrong! I’m not a good meditator! I’ll never be able to follow my breath! Most everyone who has tried to meditate has experienced some version of this self-doubt. Though it’s natural impulse, it’s not helpful. Remember, the purpose of meditation isn’t to enter a bliss state or eradicate all thinking. It’s simply to be present with what’s going on right now, whatever that is. Try to let go of any judgments you have about good meditation or bad meditation, and whether or not you’ve achieved anything. We all have the capacity for clarity, for calm and for mindfulness.
        </h5>
      <h5>Sleepiness: Many people get sleepy when they try to meditate. This may be because our minds are simply overstimulated, or it may be because our bodies are tired and need some rest. Either way, there are skillful ways to wake ourselves up so we can engage in meditation. Straighten your posture. Open your eyes. Try walking meditation. Instead of using your breath as the anchor of your attention, try listening to sounds. Or, develop a pattern of sensations to focus on: for example, first the feeling of breath passing in and out of your nostrils, then the diaphragm rising and falling, and then the gentle breeze of air just above your lips.
      </h5>
    <h5>Restlessness: We’re so used to keeping busy, that meditation can seem boring at first. If that’s the case, try focusing on very specific sensations, like the outbreath. You can even try to control your breathing, taking shorter inbreaths and longer outbreaths. Most importantly, try not to be too hard on yourself.
    </h5>
    <h5>Pain: You may feel pain when you begin to practice meditation for longer durations. It could be just a sharp, fleeting pang in your legs, or it could be dull cramps or aches in your back. Whatever it is, try to simply notice it and accept it at first. Acknowledge that it’s a feeling, just like any other feeling, and that it will eventually pass. If it persists, try directing your attention to another part of the body. And if the pain gets intolerable, adjust your posture as needed.
    </h5> 
    <h5>Fear: In the rare instance, panic or fear may arise. Should this happen, try to shift the attention toward something outside the body, like the air whooshing in and out of your nostrils, or sounds. But don’t force yourself to pay close attention to whatever it is that might be causing you emotional discomfort. And if it’s too intense, don’t worry about opening your eyes, or just taking a break.
